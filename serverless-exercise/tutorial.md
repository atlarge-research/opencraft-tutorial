# Opencraft Tutorial

Minecraft is one of the best-selling games of all time.
It has sold more than 200 million copies,<sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup> and has more than 126 million active monthly players.<sup id="a2">[2](#fn2)</sup>
In contrast to traditional games, Minecraft gives players fine-grained control over the environment.
Players can be creative and alter the environment to their liking.
Players can decide to create buildings, mines, farms, logical circuits, and other constructions.
Minecraft's success has led to the creation of hundreds of similar games, which we collectively refer to as _Minecraft-like games_.

Despite the popularity of these games, their scalability is limited.
The original Minecraft and popular spin-offs can only support between 200-300 players under favorable conditions.<sup id="a3">[3](#fn3)</sup>
To support its more than 126 million active monthly players, these games rely on the replication of small, isolated instances, preventing large groups of players from playing together.

The Opencraft research project addresses these challenges through research aimed at improving our understanding of the performance of Minecraft-like games, and the design and evaluation of novel scalability techniques.
As part of this this effort, we develop Opencraft.
Opencraft is a Minecraft-like game and research platform that is used to evaluate novel scalability techniques.

In this tutorial, you will set up, run, and conduct a basic experiment with Opencraft. After completing this tutorial, you have experience with:

1. Setting up and running a distributed system.
2. Running a distributed system.
2. Configuring a distributed system.
3. Writing code for a distributed system.
4. Analyzing the behavior of a distributed system.

# Setup â€” Hello, World!

## Connecting to the DAS-5

Append the following configuration to your SSH configuration file, located at `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host vu-data
	HostName ssh.data.vu.nl
	User VUNET_USERNAME

Host das5
	HostName fs0.das5.cs.vu.nl
	User DAS5_USERNAME
	ProxyJump vu-data
```

You should now be able to connect to the DAS-5 using the command `ssh das5`.
SSH will first request your VUnet password, and then your DAS-5 password.

> PRO TIP: If you connect to the DAS-5 regularly, it is worth switching to public-key authentication using `ssh-keygen` and `ssh-copy-id`. This is left as an exercise for the reader. Unfortunately, ssh.data.vu.nl does not accept public-key authentication, but DAS-5 does.

> PRO TIP: You do not need the `ProxyJump` command while working from the VU campus network.

## Collecting Your Tools

Opencraft consists of a collection of tools. The setup consists of two steps: creating a Python environment with the necessary packages, and downloading the Opencraft-specific tools. From this point onwards, all commands should be executed on the DAS-5, unless otherwise specified.

### Python

Use Miniconda to create a Python environment with the necessary packages.
Miniconda simplifies the process of creating portable Python environments with specfic Python runtime and package versions.

Download the Miniconda installer for Linux:

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Run the installer. It will ask where Miniconda should be installed. **Make sure to install Miniconda in `/var/scratch/<USERNAME>/miniconda3`**;
the home folder does not have sufficient space for large python environments. Answer "yes" when asked if the installer should run `conda init`.

Now create a new Python environment that contains the exact Python runtime and package versions needed to run the Opencraft tools.

```
source ~/.bashrc
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlarge-research/opencraft-tutorial/main/conda/spec-file.txt
conda create --name opencraft --file spec-file.txt
echo "conda activate opencraft" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
rm spec-file.txt
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
You should now see `(opencraft)` prepended to your terminal prompt. You can also verify the correct Python runtime is used by running `which python`.

### Opencraft Tools

To dowload and configure the Opencraft tools, run the following command:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlarge-research/opencraft-tutorial/main/scripts/setup-opencraft.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc # load the prun module
```

> PRO TIP: Never execute code straight from the Internet. :)

# Exercises

## Run Opencraft Experiment

In this section, you will run your first experiment with Opencraft.
The goal of the experiment is to find the latency of generating chunks using local generation.

Run the following command to reserve 3 machines on the DAS-5 for 900 seconds (15 minutes):

```
preserve -np 2 -t 900
```

Now use `preserve -llist` to list all reservations. Yours will be near the bottom. Note the reservation number you have been assigned, shown in the first column.

The following command uses the OpenCraft Deployer to run your first experiment.
It deploys Opencraft together with Yardstick, a benchmark that emulates players and monitors Opencraft's system behavior.

```
ocd run /var/scratch/$(whoami)/opencraft-tutorial/opencraft-experiments/2021/first-experiment <reservation-number>
```

The OpenCraft Deployer prints all commands executed to set up and perform the experiment to standard output. As you can see, most of it is moving configuration and log files around. No magic, but if these files are not in the right place, the system does not do what you want it to do.

> PRO TIP: Running your experiments in `screen` allows you to stop your SSH connection without interrupting your experiments. This is especially useful if your experiments take a long time to run, or your network connection is unreliable.

Now run the following commands to collect and plot the results from your experiment:

```
ocd collect /var/scratch/$(whoami)/opencraft-tutorial/opencraft-experiments/2021/first-experiment
python /var/scratch/$(whoami)/opencraft-tutorial/opencraft-experiments/2021/first-experiment/figures/plot-network.py
```

Because your connection to the DAS-5 is text only, you will need to move the resulting figures from the DAS-5 to your local machine before you can view them. Run the following command from your local computer:

```
scp -r das5:/var/scratch/<DAS5_USERNAME>/opencraft-tutorial/opencraft-experiments/2021/first-experiment/figures .
```

There should now be a `figures` directory on your local machine which contains several figures. Open them to view your experiment results.

#### Questions

- The experiment is configured to run the experiment once. (See `experiment-config.toml`.) What can go wrong when running an experiment only once? How can you address this risk?

## Modify Opencraft Configuration

In this section, we run a second experiment while enabling the _serverless terrain generation_ in Opencraft.
By generating chunk data on AWS Lambda we free resources on the server, which should improve user experience.

Run the following commands to create a new configuration for your current experiment:

```
cd /var/scratch/$(whoami)/opencraft-tutorial/opencraft-experiments/2021/first-experiment
mkdir -p serverless-generation/resources/config # Create a dir for the new Opencraft config. Change 'serverless-generation' if needed.
cp local-generation/resources/config/opencraft.yml serverless-generation/resources/config
```

Now use a text editor (e.g., `vim` or `nano`) to modify Opencraft's configuration. Open `serverless-generation/resources/config/opencraft.yml`, and set `opencraft.chunk-population.policy` from `default` to `naive`.

Redo the operations discussed in the [previous section](#run-opencraft-experiment) to run the experiment with the new configuration.

#### Questions
- Does changing the Opencraft policy significantly affect the behavior of the system? Why (not)?

## Wrapping Up

You have reached the end of the Opencraft tutorial. At this point, it is worth reminding yourself of what you have learned:

1. You learned to set up a distributed system on a distributed super computer.
2. You learned to run an experiment on a distributed system and observe the results.
3. You learned to use an experiment to observe how configuration changes the behavior of a distributed system.
4. You learned to write code for a distributed system by adding a new policy, and how to compare it against existing policies.

You are now ready to apply these lessons to the systems and experiments that you want to explore.

## BONUS: Connect to Your Own Opencraft Game

While debugging your Opencraft experiments, it can be useful to see what the game and its emulated players are doing. Because the DAS-5 worker nodes are not accessible from the Internet, you cannot *directly* connect to the Opencraft server with our local Minecraft client.
However, you can work around this by chaining two SSH tunnels.

Start by running Opencraft on a DAS-5 worker node by starting an experiment or by launching the game manually. Next, use `preserve -llist` to identify which machine (e.g., node0XY) is running the Opencraft server.<sup id="a4">[4](#fn4)</sup> Now create two SSH tunnels from your local machine to the worker node that is running the Opencraft server, replacing `node0XY` with the correct hostname:

```
ssh -L 25565:node0XY:25565 das5
```
*Working out how this command works exactly is left as an exercise for the reader.*

Finally, start your Minecraft 1.12.2 client on your local machine and connect to the server at `localhost:25565`. You should now be connected to the Opencraft server running on the DAS-5.
